# First-Party Plugin Matrix as Panel Runtime Consumers (CTX-0107)

## Status and provenance

- Status: **draft** — research only. This document surveys the remaining first-party
  plugin candidates before any release as consumers of the generic Panel Runtime.
  It proposes no implementation, authorizes no shipped, stable, or
  compatibility-guaranteed behavior, and does not close an open question.
  The lifecycle is `Draft -> experimental review evidence -> Accepted -> normative`;
  only `Accepted` or `normative` documents authorize shipped behavior.
  Candidate contracts remain `Proposed`/`draft` until independent review per the new
  RFC lifecycle (`Draft -> experimental review evidence -> Accepted -> normative`).

- Ownership: bitty **CTX-0107** — _Research first-party plugin matrix before release_.
  - Priority: P2 | Area: plugin | Labels: feat,area:plugin,P2 | Milestone: v0.1.0
  - RFC: OQ-011 | Task: CTX-0107 | Cross-repo textual: bitty-docs CTX-0120
  - Worktree: `.worktrees/ctx-0107`, branch `carryctx/ctx-0107`, base `5c885f2`
    (CTX-0105) plus Panel Runtime `05e8803` (CTX-0102).

- Authority: every `v0.1` gate remains `status: draft` until independent review
  per `open-questions.md`. No open question is closed here. This document does not
  add roadmap promises, does not claim Panel/Runtime/Browser/Agent behavior beyond
  the reviewed code and tests in this worktree, and does not weaken normative
  security controls in `bitty-docs/docs/security/`.

- Relationship: this is the bitty-side companion to the docs-side
  [Browser and Agent Panel Integration Pre-Study](https://github.com/bitty-terminal/bitty-ai-docs/blob/main/interfaces/browser-agent-pre-study.md)
  (CTX-0120, candidate BA-1..BA-12) and the
  [Panel Runtime and Event Bus Pre-Study](../specifications/panel-runtime-pre-study.md)
  (CTX-0119 / requested `05e8803`, candidate PR-1..PR-12). The matrix here reconciles
  the product shape (which plugins exist and at what priority) while CTX-0120
  reconciles the mechanism depth (how Browser and Agent would be isolated).

## Scope

In scope (research, not normative):

- Inventory of the **shipped** first-party set at `5c885f2` (shell-integration,
  workspace, palette, statusline, project) as verified Panel Runtime consumers and
  the stable baseline this matrix builds on.
- Survey of **remaining** first-party candidates before release as Panel Runtime
  consumers: file manager, Git panel, mail panel, AI panel, browser panel,
  plus close neighbors (editor preview, logs, scratchpad/peek, mirror) needed
  to test composition completeness.
- For each candidate: Panel host type (`View` `Terminal`/`Browser` vs `Panel`),
  policy owned by the plugin, Core mechanism relied on, illustrative capability
  sketch (`panel.*`, `fs.*`, `process.*`, `network.*`, `browser.*`, `agent.*`),
  Event Bus topics, priority before release, and distribution posture
  (bundled-disabled vs candidate-not-bundled).
- Reconciliation with the generic Panel Runtime contract at `05e8803` (CTX-0102)
  and the incremental Panel deliveries at `34eae1c` (shell-integration),
  `d799024` (workspace, formerly tabs), `5c885f2` (palette/statusline/project).

Out of scope and owned elsewhere:

- VT parser, grid, cursor, mode, damage, and reply invariants (OQ-007,
  Terminal State RFC); text segmentation and atlas
  (Text and Rendering RFC); image and scene contracts (Rich Presentation RFC).
- Plugin API v1, capability grammar, manifest, and three-level queue budgets
  (OQ-011/012/013, Plugin Platform RFC) — referenced, not redefined.
- Per-plugin VM instruction/memory/task enforcement and RC-1..RC-10 ceilings
  (OQ-014, Isolation Resource RFC) — referenced as candidate measurement.
- IPC framing, discovery, and per-connection quotas RC-9/RC-10 (OQ-018, IPC
  and Agent RFC); daemon and remote UI trust boundaries
  (ADR 0008, post-v1.0).
- Package manifest, lockfile, and activation verification
  (OQ-021/022, Package Lifecycle RFC); distribution store signing
  (OQ-029).

## Contracts reconciled

- **Plugin Platform RFC** (OQ-011/012/013, accepted 2026-08-27): closed capability
  grammar, deny-by-default, no wildcards, `fs.read:PARAM`/`fs.write:PARAM` with
  path globs, grants hash-bound to `manifest_hash`, per-subscription bounded
  queues `DropOldest` as accepted `v1` default (OQ-013 closed), `EventKind` closed
  set with four interception points fail-open veto-wins.

- **Isolation Resource RFC** (OQ-014, accepted 2026-08-28): three-level envelope
  per-subscription `64`, per-plugin `1024`/`256 KiB`, global `8192`/`2 MiB`
  hard-gated at host admission with `DropOldest`, coalescing for observation
  topics, RC-1 `10^7`/`50 ms`/`8 ms`, RC-2 `32 MiB` per VM, RC-3 `512 MiB`
  aggregate, attribution for `bitty plugin doctor`.

- **Default Distribution RFC** (OQ-002, accepted 2026-08-29): bundled does not mean
  enabled. The `v1` enabled set is empty; a fresh install with no user
  configuration starts core only, identical to `bitty --safe`. Five disable
  surfaces, generation disposal and budget reclaim, promotion criteria for any
  future enabled-by-default addition (PB-1 `<= 100 ms` p50 cold start, PB-2
  `<= 80 MiB` idle one window, PB-5 `<= 40 MiB` distribution cap, PB-7
  `<= 1%` CPU idle must hold).

- **Terminal State RFC** (OQ-007): only `Action` writes `State`. Plugins observe
  committed state via bounded `ColdEvent` -> `SideQueue<HostObservation>` or
  Panel EventBus (never grid internals), never on the hot path
  `PTY -> VT Parser -> Action -> State`.

- **Vertical slice `c0aadd2`** and **Workspace/Multi-terminal `f0f7cf1`** plus
  **Panel Runtime `05e8803`**: single-process winit one-registry-per-window
  headless, `TerminalId != ViewId` with `RuntimeId`/`PersistentId`/`Generation`,
  `Workspace -> LayoutTree (H/V) -> View` with Core-owned decoration.

## Panel Runtime contract at 05e8803 — recap

The generic Panel Runtime (CTX-0102, `05e8803`, PR #159, pre-study `9032d1e`)
reconciled with `f0f7cf1` (Workspace) and `6f30c2f`/`c3a2928` (accepted
TerminalRegistry/View and Workspace Compositor):

- `PanelId` distinct newtype with no `From` bridge to `ViewId`/`TerminalId`;
  `Generation` monotonic with reserve `1024` and fail-closed exhaustion
  (`GenerationExhausted` within `1024` of `u64::MAX`, no wrap).
- Lifecycle `Declared -> Created -> Mounted -> Focused -> Suspended -> Disposed`
  with validated state transitions; `Mounted` binds `PanelId` to an empty `ViewId`
  (`ViewContent::Panel(PanelId)` as the current research-preferred Option A).
- Closed `PanelType` set contributed by `PanelProvider` (candidate domain values
  `terminal`/`rich`/`browser`/`helper`/`canvas` validated via manifest, not invented
  per call).
- Command registry closed qualified `owner.name:command` (`^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*\.[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*:[a-z0-9_-]+$`,
  `<= 128` chars), duplicates rejected not shadowed, per-type `32` bound.
- Overlay max `4` plus `1` modal with modal exclusivity (`OverlayBusy`) and text
  `128`/tooltip `256` bounds (`Palette` kind for palette).
- Focus MRU per Workspace per Window (`PanelFocus` with MRU ordering and hidden-panel
  promotion); exactly zero or one `ViewId` or `PanelId` focused per active workspace.
- EventBus with three levels matching OQ-014: per-subscription `64`, per-panel
  `1024`/`256 KiB`, global `8192`/`2 MiB`, `8 KiB` payload (`BoundedText` strict),
  batch `32`/`8 KiB` aggregate per wakeup, `DropOldest` default with counted
  per-queue attribution and coalescing for declared topics.
- Capability isolation per `(PanelId, generation)` deny-by-default via
  `CapabilityId` panel family `panel.provider` / `panel.create` /
  `panel.focus` / `panel.overlay` — no ambient authority, no first-party bypass.

Candidate bounded defaults preserved as PR-1..PR-12 (all validated before allocation,
typed `TooManyPanels`/`UnknownPanelType`/`PanelAlreadyMounted`/`AlreadyMounted`/
`StaleHandle`/`GenerationExhausted`, transactional denial FS-P1..FS-P5):

| PR-11 | Overlay text/tooltip           | `<= 128` / `<= 256` chars                            | composition                            |

All ceilings are candidate defaults that fit inside the accepted three-level
envelope without a new global budget family. Changing a value requires a
reviewed RFC revision.

## Shipped set at 5c885f2 — reconciliation baseline

At `5c885f2` (CTX-0105, PR #167) the five `v1` candidates are shipped as
**bundled-disabled, isolated, observation-only Panel Runtime consumers** via
the public `PluginHost` path (`declare -> resolve -> register -> GrantRecord
hash-bound -> activate -> subscribe -> publish -> drain SideQueue DropOldest`)
and the PanelRegistry public path (`PanelRegistry::new -> create_panel ->
mount_panel -> focus_panel` with `PanelType::Helper`). No private channel,
`forbid(unsafe)`, bounded queues `64`/`1024`/`2 MiB`/`8192` `DropOldest` with
`8 KiB` payload and `32`/`8 KiB` batch, single-process headless without
PTY/GPU leak, default disabled (`EffectiveConfig` empty), safe-mode rejects
`bitty-terminal.*` as non-builtin without panic, identical to `example.*` parity.

Accepted rules preserved by this baseline (Default Distribution `v1`):

- Bundled does not mean enabled. `EffectiveConfig::default` has empty `plugins`
  — fresh install starts core only, identical to `bitty --safe`. Enabling is
  explicit via `ConfigPlan` (`plugins = { ["bitty-terminal.workspace"] = { enabled = true } }`)
  with capability consent and the permission-diff gate (R-016/R-022) for
  capability-increasing updates. Old id `bitty-terminal.tabs` remains as a
  deprecated alias (removal ≥ v0.2.0). A bitty workspace is a tab group within
  a window (wezterm inverts this: workspace > window > tab > pane).
- Project-scoped or workspace configuration may narrow the enabled set but may
  never add a capability the user has not granted (`apply_workspace_narrowing`
  rejects additions). Unknown capabilities fail validation; no wildcards, no `*`.
- Plugins are observation-only and off the parser/render/input hot paths; bounded
  decoding; generation-scoped ownership; `bitty plugin doctor` attributable drops.

`splits` and `search` remain explicitly deferred as future candidates (not
bundled, not implemented at `5c885f2`). `Panel Runtime` itself is the host
mechanism at `05e8803`, not a product plugin.

## Candidate remaining matrix — Panel Runtime consumers before release

The remaining candidates are evaluated as **future Panel Runtime consumers**,
not as shipped plugins. Each must reuse the Panel lifecycle
(`Declared -> Created -> Mounted -> Focused -> Suspended -> Disposed`), the
`ViewContent::Panel(PanelId)` (or `ViewContent::Browser` for browser) placement,
command/overlay/focus/EventBus surfaces with their bounded ceilings, and the
capability deny-by-default gate. No candidate invents a hot-path hook, a
private host channel, or ambient filesystem/network authority.

Topics are illustrative qualified `owner.name:topic` strings bounded `<= 64`
bytes; payloads obey `PR-5..PR-9` (`8 KiB` per event, `32`/`8 KiB` batch,
`DropOldest` with coalescing for observation topics). Capabilities obey the
closed grammar from the Plugin Platform RFC; families not listed are not
implied.

### Close neighbors that test composition completeness

These are not separately requested in the CTX-0107 short list but are the
standard companions that decide whether the Panel Runtime is complete without
inventing a private channel. Priority reflects reuse of the same `panel.*` +
`fs.*`/`process.*` surface rather than new budget families.

| `bitty-terminal.peek`           | overlay or transient `Panel(PanelId)` (peek/preview on zone)      | Hover/preview anchored to semantic zone or rich block without entering grid geometry      | `Rich` block anchor plus `layout` geometry for placement; overlay `4+1` if used                                                                                           | `panel.overlay` / `ui.overlay` + `terminal.semantic-read`                        | **P2**   | candidate, not bundled |

`splits` and `search` (from plugin-dogfood deferred set) stay as future
candidates as well — `splits` reuses the same `LayoutNode` `H`/`V` primitive
through `PanelRuntime` placement without a new tiling node, `search` as
observation-only `terminal.semantic-read` + `ui.overlay` with bounded snapshot
correctness, not as a hot-path hook.

## Priority before release

No release ships any plugin enabled-by-default (`v1` enabled set is empty).
Ordering below is **research build order**, not a date promise. It reflects
composition coverage and trust cost.

- **Next (P1)** — validate the Panel platform is useful without privileged
  surfaces:
  1. `file-manager` — proves tiled `Panel(PanelId)` workspace, `fs.*` path-glob
     isolation with real-path/symlink/device checks, cwd observation, and
     file->editor open via `owner.name:topic` composition. Highest reuse of the
     shipped `project` discovery shape with wider directory scope, so the design
     pressure is to tighten — not widen — `fs.read` grants.
  2. `git-panel` — proves the CLI adapter composition path (`process.spawn:git(...)`
     with `[tools.git]` manifest allowlist) and `project`+`git` context assembly
     without embedding `libgit2` or adding a new tiling primitive.

  Both stay **not bundled before release** until their constrained `fs`/`process`
  review; they exercise `PR-1..PR-12` plus the existing `Fs`/`Process` families
  with no new global budget.

- **After P1, P2** — prove privileged panel types are host-mediated, not ambient: 3. `browser-panel` — the first host-owned surface (`BrowserSurfaceId`) with
  a web process isolated from the terminal truth. Requires R-005
  `FileUrlActivation` for `file://`, destination allowlist, and RC-3
  accounting; BA-1..BA-3 ceilings. Stay out of distribution until that RFC. 4. `ai-panel` — the first consent-scoped agent surface (`AgentId` plus
  `AgentWorkspace` plus `32 KiB` Context Budget). Requires four-level
  `inspect`/`self`/`workspace`/`all` consent, MCP Tool Bus scoping per
  `(AgentId, generation)`, and secret-minimizing `SecretField` redaction.
  BA-7..BA-10 ceilings. Stay out of distribution until that RFC and the
  draft AI Architecture (`ModelProvider`/`ContextProvider`) contract stabilize. 5. `editor-preview` and `peek` — exercise Rich `anchor`/`scene` and overlay
  placement without mutating grid, closing the file->preview composition loop
  started by `file-manager`.

- **Deferred (P3, post-P1/P2)** — validate quota-bounded or network-secret
  surfaces only after the P1/P2 gates have review evidence:
  `mail-panel` (network + token secrecy), `logs` (long-running helper), `mirror`
  and `scratchpad` (snapshot versioning / quota storage). None is a terminal
  correctness dependency.

If any P1/P2 candidate needs a host capability or a new `PanelType` that is not
yet a closed `CapabilityId` family or `PanelType` member, the boundary is
incomplete and the plugin must not ship until the family is promoted via a

All rows obey the same panel-bus rules: topics are manifest-declared `owner.name:topic`
`<= 64` bytes; producing or consuming an undeclared topic fails with
`UndisclosedTopic`; high-value topics that carry raw PTY or clipboard bytes inherit
the high-risk consent of `terminal.raw-read`/`clipboard.read`; no bus topic grants
a capability.

## Budget attribution (how the candidates fit inside accepted ceilings)

- **No new global budget family is introduced.** Every plugin candidate reuses
  the accepted OQ-014 three-level envelope (`PerSub 64`, `PerPlugin 1024`/`256 KiB`,
  `Global 8192`/`2 MiB` with `DropOldest`/`DropNewest` alternative) plus
  `PR-1..PR-12` Panel Runtime defaults and CTX-0120 BA-1..BA-12 Browser/Agent
  defaults. Aggregate Browser+MCP+Agent+Panel+Plugin bus traffic shares the same
  global `8192`/`2 MiB` envelope; a Browser burst is the same global-limit event
  as a plugin burst, not a second ceiling.
- **RC-1/RC-2 per-VM**: `file-manager` and `git-panel` when enabled are ordinary
  Lua VM plugins — `10^7` instructions / `50 ms` wall / `8 ms` instruction
  slice per turn and `32 MiB` heap via `piccolo` Fuel+wall and
  `Lua::total_memory()`, measured via `crates/bitty-plugin-host/tests/measurement.rs`
  and `crates/bitty-lua/tests/measurement_lua.rs` (CTX-0094 envelope).
  `browser-panel` surface memory beyond queues (web process heap, image cache)
  is accounted under RC-3 aggregate, not as a new per-VM free pool.
- **RC-3 aggregate**: kept `512 MiB` aggregate under which Browser embedder,
  Agent helper processes, and any MCP servers cohabit; no new per-window process
  budget is opened without an RFC.
- **Payloads**: `8 KiB` per `emit`/`mcp.invoke` (`BoundedText` strict) and batch
  `32`/`8 KiB` aggregate per wakeup, verified by `would_exceed_global_limits` +
  `evict_oldest_globally` and `invariant_global_bounds`.
- **Safe startup preserved**: even if any of `file-manager`, `git-panel`,
  `browser-panel`, `ai-panel`, or `mail-panel` were present in a future
  distribution, a fresh install with no user configuration still starts core only
  (`EffectiveConfig` empty, `bitty --safe` zero third-party VMs, 0.1.0 distribution
  integrity via `distribution.toml` + `checksums.sha256` and `PB-5` `<= 40 MiB`
  cap per the Default Distribution RFC).

## Placement reconciliation

Panel as candidate typed `View` content (`ViewContent::Panel(PanelId)`) with the
accepted `View` `Browser(BrowserSurfaceId)` already present (Option A of the
pre-study) is the research preference carried forward here, aligned with the
hierarchy `Instance -> Window -> Workspace -> LayoutTree { H | V | View }` owned
by `Workspace`. The alternatives considered are:

- Panel as `LayoutTree` leaf replacing `View` — rejected (breaks `ViewId`
  generation history).
- Panel side-car map `ViewId -> PanelId` outside `ViewContent` — rejected
  (second host map).

`LayoutProvider::propose` stays pure deterministic and bounded
(`WorkspaceSnapshot` + `ViewId` set + `LogicalRect` -> `LayoutTree`); any proposal
carrying decoration or mutating panel state is rejected. The Event Bus is
in-process first; any cross-process routing would reuse the accepted IPC transport
with peer-credential auth and per-request scope evaluation, not an ambient
channel. This matches the placement adopted for the shipped `workspace` proof
(`workspace.rs` reuses `Stack`/`Split` with deterministic leaf order, no new tiling
primitive, bounded `32` leaves; `tabs.rs` remains only as a deprecated alias).

## Explicit exclusions (not authorized)

The following remain out of scope for this matrix and are not authorized as
shipped, stable, or compatibility-guaranteed behavior by this draft:

- Daemon `bittyd` and session persistence across reboots — post-v1.0 per ADR 0008;
  process-scoped runtime only.
- Remote UI and cross-host transport — new trust boundary not evaluated here.
- Multi-window as global server — Window stays native OS object; orchestrating many
  windows adds focus/DPI/lifetime questions beyond `PR-1..PR-2`.
- WASM or helper-process strong isolation for panels — native in-process plugins
  remain rejected; WASM/helper design needs its own RFC (helper-process reuse is
  candidate only via IPC framing).
- Browser embed per-window process budget beyond isolation ceilings — reuses
  `browser.embed` gate and existing RC-3 aggregate; no new ceiling here.
- Panel distribution preset or marketplace ownership (`bitty-dev`, `LazyBitty`,
  `awesome-bitty`) — owned by the Default Distribution RFC and any future panel
  distribution RFC; this matrix notes them as composition outcomes, not as a new
  bundled-enabled set.
- New global file, network, or process ambient for Lua — violates invariant 2;
  panels obtain those only via explicit `fs.*`/`network.*`/`process.spawn:CONSTRAINT`.
- New hot-path `input.pre-encode` interception point — would put Lua on the hot
  path; panels observe via commands and `focus.changed` observation only.

Claiming any excluded behavior by citing this matrix is a documentation hygiene
violation.

## Verification — docs only

This task is docs-only and bounded. No product code is added. Verification is:

```bash
just check          # fmt-check + clippy -D warnings + test + actionlint + markdownlint (0 issues)
git diff --check    # no whitespace errors
```

On this worktree at `5c885f2` + `05e8803` + this task delta:

- `just check` — PASS expected (prettier via `bunx --bun` `prettier 3.9.6` pinned in
  `justfile`, markdownlint `0` issues, `actionlint` `1.7.12`).
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings`,
  `cargo test --workspace --all-targets`, `cargo check --workspace --all-targets`,
  `cargo check --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --workspace --all-targets` — PASS
  expected (no code changes; existing suites `palette_statusline_project_panel`,
  `workspace_panel`, `tabs_compat`, `panel_gaps`, `shell_integration_panel`, `bundled_dogfood` remain green).

## Unresolved risks and follow-up

- **Built-in namespace prefix for Panel plugins**: `PluginHost::declare` safe-mode
  currently checks `starts_with("bitty.")` as the candidate built-in namespace.
  The shipped five use `bitty-terminal.*`, treated as non-builtin and thus rejected
  in safe mode (parity with third-party `example.*`). Future file-manager/git/browser
  panels would inherit the same check; promoting `bitty-terminal.*` needs a reviewed
  change.

- **Filesystem grant width**: `file-manager` must not widen into ambient `fs.read`.
  The shipped `project` shape shows the narrowing pattern: `fs.read:~/projects/**`
  (`4096` bound) with pure `is_within_projects` + host real-path/symlink/device
  rejection, no `fs.write`. Every new `fs.*` candidate needs the same pattern.
  Manifest-time pattern validation is deny-by-default against overbroad roots:
  a `~`-rooted pattern must name a literal first child (bare `~`, `~/**`,
  `~/.*`, and foreign `~user` homes fail closed), segments naming sensitive
  credential locations (`.ssh`, `.gnupg`, `.aws`, `.azure`, `.kube`, `.docker`,
  and the `~/.config/gh`/`gcloud` prefixes) are rejected case-insensitively on
  either separator, and dot/empty segments are normalized away first so
  spelling variants cannot bypass (`bitty` #800, CTX-0489). The canonical
  capability-pattern grammar stays with the plugin corpus in
  [plugin-platform-rfc.md](https://github.com/bitty-terminal/bitty-plugins-docs/blob/main/specifications/plugin-platform-rfc.md);
  this bullet records the shipped hardening only.

- **Queue budgets remain candidate values**: `PerSub 64`, `PerPlugin 1024`/`256 KiB`,
  `Global 8192`/`2 MiB`, batch `32`/`8 KiB`, Panel `PR-1..PR-12` and Browser/Agent
  `BA-1..BA-12` are enforced headlessly where implemented and remain candidate
  defaults elsewhere. Exact timeout milliseconds and `RC-1`/`RC-2` instruction/memory
  enforcement are OQ-014 candidates; the Lua VM (`piccolo`) seam is measured but
  not normative for Panel/Agent yet.

- **Panel placement not yet Accepted**: `ViewContent::Panel(PanelId)` Option A is
  research preference only. A future Panel RFC must decide placement and must state
  any `ViewId` vs `PanelId` migration explicitly before any `file-manager`/`git`/
  `browser`/`ai` implementation claims it.

- **Browser and Agent stay candidate**: this matrix and CTX-0120 both record
  `browser-panel` and `ai-panel` as **candidate only, not bundled before release**.
  Any future enabled-by-default addition needs the six Default Distribution
  promotion gates (lightweight budget proof PB-1/PB-2/PB-7, capability minimality,
  failure isolation, hot-path exclusion, explicit disable preservation, independent
  security + docs-curator sign-off).
