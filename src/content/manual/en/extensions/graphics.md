# graphics (native extension)

Bounded PNG decode plus the raster mechanics subset for inline images. Placement policy, rect helpers, and renderer upload validation stay in Core (`bitty-graphics` README; `src/kitty_decode.rs`, `src/kitty_raster.rs`, `src/geometry.rs`).

- Source checkout: `$BITTY_WORKSPACE/bitty-graphics` ([github.com/bitty-terminal/bitty-graphics](https://github.com/bitty-terminal/bitty-graphics))
- Crate: `bitty-graphics` (library, `src/lib.rs`)
- Maturity: landed and independently verified; single `0.0.1` library crate.

## Install status

> Unpublished — verified 2026-10-16 (CDN `extensions/` probes return 404; see the [catalog overview](overview.md)). There is no version to pass to `extension install`.

Track the source checkout above. This is the extension bitty#2143 names (`extension install bitty-graphics --version X.Y.Z`): the command shape is real, but no `bitty-graphics` bundle exists yet, so there is no version to substitute. Once a prebuilt ships, installation follows the standard shape:

```bash
bitty extension list   # confirm what is staged today (empty table, exit 0)
# Later, when published:
# bitty extension install bitty-graphics --version X.Y.Z
```

## Lua / host surface

This crate exposes no direct `bitty.*` Lua namespace. It is Core-consumed mechanism: decode and raster math run behind Core's graphics intake, which enforces protocol, placement, and resource bounds. Lua plugins never call it directly.

## Minimal config

Native extensions take no per-extension user config file. Verify staging only:

```bash
bitty extension list
```
